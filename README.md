# Heroes
List of heroes I make for IceFrog to see(hopefully).

#NOTE: The hero scripts and whatnot will unlikely be finished(Hasn't even started) because I can't download dota 2 or its workshop files due to 512kbps connection bandwidth.

#NOTE2: Many hero aspects have been eyeballed. I planned on adjusting them after making practical tests(nevermore coming :( ).

1- Guardian Golem.
2- Iron Golem.
3- Power Golem.
4- Apocalypse.
