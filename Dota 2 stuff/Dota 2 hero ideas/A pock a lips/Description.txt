Hero lore :Race: Human :Age: 27 - 35 :Height: 192cm :Gender: Male

Similar to Silencer's role, this guy is an experiment of genetic enhancement
towards a more powerful magical being. The result is a guy who can store
mana inside his body AND outside his body without using any items.
Realizing how strong he can be, this guy decides to learn and master
spells that gain power the more mana one has and use that to prevent
factions from making humans like him. He kills the guys who made
him btw.
