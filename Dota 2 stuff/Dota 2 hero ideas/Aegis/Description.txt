Hero lore :Race: Human :Age: 60-ish :Height: 181cm :Gender: Male

An alchemist who found out a type of bacteria that existed in absolute
filth. The bacteria showed great feats of survival in its habitat but hardened
quickly in cleaner environments. He decided to experiment with his
finding and eventually realized the it was actually multiple different organic
cells that performed like a factory; one part eating its surroundings and
waste onto the other cell, the other one taking the waste and producing
hardened matter from it,etc. He experimented on these hungry organic
microfactories and eventually found out which substances they couldn't
eat and which ones made them produce different matter and from these
results, managed to make a suit of armor that could adapt to virtually
any environment so long as the armor was sustained.

Hero role:
Hyper tank that can become extremely difficult to take down, only issue
is his lack of utility, items are needed to complete his role, without which
he'll be easily kiteable and without any damage source.


(for 3D modelling purposes)
Hero theme: Basic human silhouette, exotic organic appearance, small glowing protrusions(akin to fungi), twisted
and stretched tissue makes up most of the surface.
