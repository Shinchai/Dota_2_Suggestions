Hero lore :Race: Human :Age: 60-ish :Height: 181cm :Gender: Male

An alchemist who found out a type of bacteria that existed in absolute
filth. The bacteria showed great feats of survival in its habitat but hardened
quickly in cleaner environments. He decided to experiment with his
finding and eventually realized the was actually multiple different organic
cells that performed like a factory; one part eating its surroundings and
shitting on the other cell, the other one taking the shit and producing
hardened matter from it,etc. He experimented on these hungry organic
microfactories and eventually found out which substances they couldn't
eat and which ones made them produce different matter and from these
results, managed to make a suit of armor that could adapt to virtually
any environment so long as the armor was fed.

Hero role:
Hyper tank that can become extremely difficult to take down, only issue
is his lack of utility, items are needed to complete his role, without which
he'll be easily kiteable and without any damage source.
