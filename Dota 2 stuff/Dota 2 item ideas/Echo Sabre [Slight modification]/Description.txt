Passive: Echo Strike

	Old mechanic:
		Upon triggering, maximize attack speed for 1 attack.
		
	New mechanic:
		Upon triggering, create a ghost character that strikes the unit it was
		triggered on. 
		
	This relieves the hero from having to strike again as the ghost hero
	will automatically strike for him.
	
	Old mechanic scenario:
	-hero hits, triggering echo.
	-Echo buff applied to hero, hero has to hit again to make use of 
	the attack speed.
	
	New mechanic scenario:
	
	-Hero hits, triggering echo.
	-Echo starts hitting, hero is free to move away or start hit animation
